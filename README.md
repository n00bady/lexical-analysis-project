## Description
`cimplified_parser` is a simplified syntax for easy parsing  
`c_parser` actually parses proper C grammar but only for few cases. It can understand:
if, for and while statements in their basic form, function calls and functions 
declarations(not all) assignments(not all) and return statements.

## Build & Run
Move to any folder and then simplly run `make` to build and `make clean` to clean unnecessary build files.
To run the `c_parser`  simply execute `./output <file>` where <file> is a C code source file.
